This document describes the world of Akagoria.

== History

=== Ancient Age

Many thousands years ago, the Six Divines created the world of Akagoria. Ale created life, Ike created evil, Moli created death. Then Pona, Sewi and Sijelo created the Humans giving them health, magic and vitality. The Divines lived among the Humans for many years. Nobody knows exactly how it ended, but the Divines disappeared. That was the end of the Ancient Age.
