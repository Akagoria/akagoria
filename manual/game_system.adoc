.Attributes of the main character
image::attributes.png[Attributes]

All attributes start at 50% and cannot go above 100% or beyond 10%. When an attribute is used (through its associated skills, see <<skills>>), it is enhanced and its two opposed attributes are reduced. The siblings attributes are unchanged. More precisely, if an attribute receives stem:[x] points, then stem:[\frac{x}{2}] points are taken from its two opposed attributes. As a consequence, the total points for all the attributes remains the same: 250%.

=== Aspects

- Health
- Magic
- Vitality

.. Compute the extent of success: stem:[E = 1 + \frac{S - R}{100}]
